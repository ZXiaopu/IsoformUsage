RNA-seq data were from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-GEUV-1/files/processed/
 
Step1(00.getWindows.R): Generating window model
       Merging all exons from each isoform of the same gene (MergedExon)
       Mapping model is composed of MergedExon, Intron(regions between MergedExon), Up/downstream regions
       Dividing each region into several windows

Step2(01.eachGeneFile.R): Mapping RNA-seq data to each region （bedtools）then calculating reads fraction for each window

step3(02.Baseline.R): Logistic regression model is the baseline model
