RNA-seq data were from https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-GEUV-1/files/processed/

Step1: Merging all exons from each isoform of the same gene (MergedExon)

Step2: Generating mapping model
       Mapping model is composed of MergedExon, Intron(regions between MergedExon), Up/downstream regions
       
Step3: Generating window model
       Dividing each region into several windows

Step4: Mapping RNA-seq data to each region
       Each gene is a seperate file
