# IsoformUsage

The code in this repository is that used in Zhang, X., Hassan, M.A. & Prendergast, J.G.D. Using machine learning to detect the differential usage of novel gene isoforms. BMC Bioinformatics 23, 45 (2022). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-022-04576-3

The code is broken down into two folders:

dataProcess: Preparation of the data for the machine learning models

dataAnalysis: Model fitting and downstream analyses
